This is where we learn how to write LSTM models! :)

create sample datasets
input: [1, 2, 3] -> output: 4
input: [2, 3, 4] -> output: 5

batch first notes
-----------------

Batch first means:
The first number in your data shape is the number of samples (batch size).

For example, if you have 4 samples, each with 3 time steps, and 1 feature per step:

With batch first, your data shape is:
(4, 3, 1) — batch size first.

Without batch first (default), your data shape is:
(3, 4, 1) — time steps first.

It just changes how you organize your data so the model can read it correctly.
